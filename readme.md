This lesson is about making use of the skills learned in the previous courses. This includes basic elements such as titles, basic formatting, pictures and links. 
Equally important is the process of pushing progress to git. 

I hope to refresh on the skills I learned in the last couple of weeks and use this lesson as a re-entry after my pause of 5 days.
